# AIR SPECTER

AIR SPECTER is a hardware tool designed using a Raspberry Pi 3+ model and an external NIC card. It is developed with the objective of creating a rogue access point (AP) to compromise Wi-Fi networks and perform network traffic monitoring and manipulation. The tool aims to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and systems connected within the target organization's network.




## Features and Functionality

The key features and functionality of the AIR SPECTER tool include:

- **Rogue AP Creation:** AIR SPECTER is capable of emulating a legitimate Wi-Fi network, creating a rogue access point that appears genuine to lure unsuspecting users.

- **Network Traffic Monitoring:** The tool intercepts and captures network traffic passing through the rogue AP, enabling the monitoring of packets exchanged between users and servers.

- **Packet Analysis:** AIR SPECTER analyzes the intercepted network packets, examining packet headers and payloads to identify potential vulnerabilities, sensitive information, and security weaknesses.

- **Vulnerability Assessment:** The tool assesses the security vulnerabilities present in the intercepted network traffic, providing insights into weak encryption protocols, insecure authentication mechanisms, and misconfigured devices within the target network.

- **Packet Manipulation:** AIR SPECTER allows for the manipulation of network packets, enabling simulation of attacks and modification of packet content to test the network's resilience against specific threats.

- **Data Extraction:** The tool focuses on extracting sensitive information from the intercepted network traffic, such as login credentials, personal data, or any other valuable information that can be exploited for unauthorized access.

- **Reporting and Visualization:** AIR SPECTER generates comprehensive reports based on the findings and analysis of the intercepted network traffic. It presents statistics, charts, and visual representations to facilitate the understanding of captured data.

- **Countermeasures:** The tool suggests countermeasures and security enhancements for the target network, providing recommendations to address identified vulnerabilities, strengthen network security, and prevent future attacks.
